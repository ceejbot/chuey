# chuey

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ceejbot/chuey.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A client library for the Philips Hue API.

My goal is to write a promise-and-callback up-to-date client that is API-compatible with [hue.js](https://github.com/thatguydan/hue.js). One exception: I return promises from async methods, not `this` for chaining.
